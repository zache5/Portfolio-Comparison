# Portfolio Investment Comparison

### The purpose of this project is to identify which portfolio is the strongest investment, based on percentage returns, volitlity, variance to the market, as well as overall performance. By doing this analysis, we will be able to conclude which portfolio would have generated the greatest return, with the best risk to reward ratio.

## Technologies
### In this code, I used pandas, pathlib, matplotlib, and numpy.


## Installation Guide
### import pandas as pd, from pathlib import Path, %matplotlib inline, import, numpy as np

## Usage
### As a result of what was created, a firm would be able to confidently select the best investment, based on the previous returns, as well as risk to reward metrics. I created visuals, such as a box plot to determine the spread or volitlity of each of the portfolios.
